# LoRA_Fine-Tuning

## Problem Statement
Fine-tuning LLMs on domain-specific tasks enhances their performance in real-world applications. This project involves selecting a dataset, model, and fine-tuning framework to adapt a base model for medical reasoning, an essential use case in healthcare AI systems.

### Dataset: FreedomIntelligence/medical-o1-reasoning-SFT
-  Domain Relevance:
  - The dataset contains clinically relevant questions and answers, making it highly applicable to real-world healthcare use cases such as diagnostic support, triage assistants, and Q&A bots.
- Instruction-Based Format:
  - Each entry is structured with instruction, input, and output fields, which are essential for instruction-tuned LLMs and compatible with libraries like Unsloth.
- Reasoning-Oriented:
  - The tasks emphasize multi-step reasoning, explanation, and critical thinking rather than simple factual recall, matching the capabilities of LLMs like Mistral.
- SFT-Ready:
  - Designed for supervised fine-tuning, the dataset is plug-and-play with SFTTrainer and FastLanguageModel, reducing preprocessing time.
- Educational and Research Value:
 - The dataset is ideal for research and development of safe, interpretable AI in the medical field.

In summary, this dataset empowers the model to learn domain-specific reasoning patterns essential for trusted healthcare applications.


### Model: Mistral-7B v0.3 (7B)
- Balance of size and performance:
  - 7B parameters allow for solid reasoning capabilities while still trainable on consumer GPUs with LoRA.
- 2.2x faster inference:
  - Version 0.3 is optimized for performance, accelerating both training and deployment.
- Open-source and modifiable:
  - Ideal for experimentation, academic projects, and low-cost deployment.
- Strong performance on instruction-following tasks, making it ideal for the datasetâ€™s format.


### Fine-Tuning Library: Unsloth
- Memory-Efficient:
  - Supports 4-bit/8-bit quantization and LoRA to significantly reduce memory usage.
- Fast Training:
  - Optimized training pipelines can be up to 2x faster than traditional Transformer workflows.
- Integrated with Hugging Face: Works seamlessly with Hugging Face models, tokenizers, and datasets.
- Simple API:
  - The FastLanguageModel and SFTTrainer abstractions reduce code complexity and support rapid prototyping.


### Summary
This approach enables a fast, memory-efficient fine-tuning pipeline to specialize a general-purpose LLM into a healthcare-focused assistant using the powerful Mistral model and Unsloth library. The selected components balance performance, efficiency, and ease of use, making them well-suited for this assignment and real-world deployment.
